To overcome the frustration of python text encoding (https://pythonhosted.org/kitchen/unicode-frustrations.html)
I am implementing the follwing strategy:

    The properties of a word are of type 'unicode'. Whenever an operation involves IO ,including printing to the stdout,
    then the word's properties are first encoded and then the information is passed as bytes. In reverse, we retrieve the
    bytes and construct a 'Word' type with its properties decoded from bytes to unicode.
